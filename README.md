This project is a simple customer management system built with Vue.js. It allows you to view a list of customers and add new customer information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Setting Up and Running the Project

To install the Customer Management App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-management-app.git
   ```
   Replace `https://github.com/your-username/customer-management-app.git` with the actual repository URL.

2. Install the required packages and dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Once the installation is complete, you can run the local development server:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens the app in your default web browser. You should see the application running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
